The study of biomaterials is called biomaterials science or biomaterials engineering. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine, biology, chemistry, tissue engineering and materials science.",

Almost all polymers use carbon atoms in very long chains. The carbon atoms may be attached to other carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen atoms. Polymers may or may not have an orderly arrangement of atoms.",

      "description": "Composites are mixtures of two or more bonded materials. Composites are the mixture of multiple materials, which in combination offer superior properties to the materials alone. Structural composites usually refer to the use of fibers which are embedded in a plastic. These composites offer high strength with very little weight.",
